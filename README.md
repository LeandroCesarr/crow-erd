This project is an entity diagram editor, developed with Next.js, an open-source React web application framework that enables server-side rendering and client-side rendering for web applications. This editor allows users to create, visualize, and edit entity diagrams easily and efficiently.

## Features

- **Entity Diagram Creation:** Users can create entity diagrams by dragging and dropping elements onto the workspace.
- **Intuitive Editing:** Intuitive tools allow users to add, remove, and connect entities and attributes to create custom entity diagrams.
- **Clear Visualization:** Entity diagrams are rendered clearly and organized, making it easy to understand and analyze the relationships between entities and attributes.
- **Export and Import:** Users can export entity diagrams to various file formats and also import previously created diagrams for editing or viewing. Currently, the only way to save progress is by exporting a JSON file.
